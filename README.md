# To Do List

An example of how to do a simple todo list with React:

This is a personal project, but feel free to peek inside. I made this for three reasons:

- I have started several side projects recently, without finishing them. I wanted to _publish something_. Mission accomplished! ðŸŽ‰
- I'm teaching a friend programming, so this is a nice example for the UI and the features are beginner-friendly.
- It's the perfect demo for my latest rapid-prototyping library, **[`statux`](http://github.com/franciscop/statux)**. Go check it out ðŸ˜„
- I've come a long way since I started doing React. Moved to hooks and pure functions, switched to Styled Components and couldn't be happier, etc. A todo list seems like the perfect case to see how the syntax is.
